### What is Python ?
Python is a cross-platform programming language, which means that it can run on multiple platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, and has even been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines. It is free and open-source.

### Where is it used?
**Python** is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is used in:

 - Game Development
 - Web Development
 - Data Science and Visualizations
 - Machine Learning
 - Artificial Intelligence

Compared to other programming languages, Python has simple, easy-to-use syntax. This makes Python an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.

### Running Python -
There are many ways to run **Python**.
Some ways are given below - 

- Install an IDE such as [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/)
- Install [Python Complier ](https://www.python.org/downloads/)     - to run Python in a separate platform on a pc.
- After installing Python, run it in the **Command Line**
- Run it in an online compiler such as [Programmiz Online Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) and [W3 Schools Online Compiler](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_compiler)


## Let's run our first Python Program -

Now that we have our **Python Compiler** ready, let's run our first python program.

Type:
```python
print("Hello World!")
```

Output:
```
Hello World!
```

This is program will be explained further in the next tutorial.

You have created your first python program and just started the amazing journey in learning Python.
